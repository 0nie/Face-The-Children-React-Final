  description: "Historically in the Philippines, due to widespread poverty, the problem of abandoned, abused, or dangerously neglected (AADN) children has been remarkably large. Many hundreds of thousands of children, perhaps millions, have grown up living mostly on the streets. There is very minimal governmental protection or assistance for what are often termed 'street children,' and in class-segregated social systems these children are not only viewed as a nuisance, but are the target of a wide variety of evils.",
